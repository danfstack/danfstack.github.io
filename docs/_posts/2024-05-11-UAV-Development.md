# Terminator meets Verdun

This year, the number of UAVs deployed in Ukraine will exceed the number of soldiers and vehicles on the battlefield. This marks a significant milestone in the history of warfare, combining advanced technology reminiscent of the Terminator with the attrition warfare seen in Verdun 1916. Even with today's limited UAV autonomy, an automated killing field is emerging. In the first two months of 2024, the Ukrainian defense industry produced about 200 thousand FPV drones, and the Deputy Minister for Strategic Industries of Ukraine has stated that the Ukrainian production capacity will reach 2 million by the end of 2024 (1). As the war grinds on and shells and Western assistance dries up, Ukraine is fighting with the systems they have, and Russia has in turn grasped their utility and now mass-produces them in a vicious arms race spurred by Ukrainian ingenuity. Already the battlefield is more transparent than any other in history, with soldiers and vehicles in the open easily targeted. In the words of Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Flesh:

> In six months to a year, both sides will begin to produce enough FPVs to target every single soldier - all will be detected and destroyed day and night in a zone of up to 8 km. All infantry will retreat underground, and all surface activity will belong to robots. (2)

The terrifying experience this will produce for those fighting this war is a somber reality, that will be transmitted to your phone 24/7 so you can watch snuff films of whichever side you think has lost the moral case. This essay will examine how this arms race is progressing, in terms of the quality and quantity of systems being produced, and later try to detail some of the implications for the wider world and the future of warfare. 

How do UAVs qualitatively improve? There are several qualities that move along the "kill chain" towards the target. Each is on its own learning curve in the evolving technical, tactical and strategic landscape. Much of the information here comes from Perun (3), a fantastic youtube channel covering the military industrial complex. 

# Sensors (seek the target)
Currently UAVs can only operate in daytime, fair weather conditions. Thermal cameras are expensive and not feasible for one way drones at the moment, although this may be changing with Ukrainian drone production groups such as Wild Hornets now claiming to produce a solution that allows UAVs to fly at night for only $50. If night used to provide partial protection for soldiers in the field, this will slowly be eroded until the battlefield is transparent to both armies at all times.

# Range (reach the target)
Already the range of UAVs has been extended over the course of the war from 3 km to 20 km. Increasing the range of your weapons obviously has great implications for the tactical and strategic landscape, and any edge you have over your opponent is easily exploited. As time goes on, deeper strikes will become increasingly common, with production shifting from commercial off-the-shelf (e.g. DJI Mavics) to specialised artisanal production involving mechanical improvements to the airframe and the stripping of non-essential components. Suicide drones don't require motors to be rated for hundreds of hours unlike commercial drones, and component swaps like these will be made again and again to bring down the cost of a kill from ~$1700 now to ~$1000 this year, as predicted by the Ukrainian chief of military production Oleksandr Kamyshin (4). The fact that death is already dealt out at such a low cost is a remarkable and depressing fact. Both sides now use repeater drones which act as relays to increase range and reach into places where the horizon, terrain or buildings might block a radio signal. As this becomes more sophisticated you can imagine a mother ship acting as a relay for a wing of lighter drones with minimal computing and communications on the airframe, with the entire payload able to be given over to explosives.

An interesting example of changing material choices is the use of drones made from waxed cardboard developed by Australian company Sypaq. They have been sent in the hundreds to Ukraine, and used to attack Russian airfields behind the lines. The material choice offers weather resistance, flat-pack transportation and a lightweight airframe, which enables a longer flight range and a high cruise speed of 60km/h. It also greatly lowers the radar signature of the drone. Innovations from strong commercial industries in Ukrainian allied countries like Australia will compete with Iranian and Chinese industry in this proxy war.

# Guidance (hit the target)
Currently the major bottleneck to UAV production is the commercial flight controllers that make up the majority of the cost of a ~$500 drone. However, Ukrainian production of flight controllers is just kicking off, and undoubtedly the trend is for compute, imagery and memory all to be increasingly available at lower prices, along with algorithmic improvements that will make each drone more autonomous. Solutions that can identify targets in soldiers and vehicles, to be confirmed by an operator, are being tested and will be increasingly effective. Computer vision is a mature field that is being engineered at a rapid pace to develop solutions that can target even in the face of camouflage and concealment and without any communication link to an operator. If drones can autonomously target and engage enemies, electronic warfare and jamming will become obsolete and there will be no defense except a "hard kill" (shooting drones out of the air).  

# Payload (effect the target)
There are three main levels at which payloads are calibrated towards their target. 

* <1kg: Exposed infantry. Payload includes hand grenades, VOG 30mm. 
* 2.5kg+: Anti-armour. Payload includes RPG warheads, tandem charges. 
* 10kg+: Strategic targets.

The size of the airframe determines the size of the payload it can carry. Wild Hornets produces several sizes for different purposes: 7- or 8-inch models carry a 1.5 kg payload and 10-inch models carry a 2.5 kg payload, both with ranges up to 20 km although the majority of strikes are at 10 km or less. Larger payloads, along with reusable bombing drones are possible, although the desired targets can already be affected at these levels. The main advances will come from better guidance and targeting rather than increasing payload size. 

# Countermeasure resistance (don't get jammed)
Today the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is at the heart of all operational functions in war, including communication systems, active and passive detection systems, and electronic attack systems (5). These systems are distributed over the entire EMS. All over the battlefield, electronic warfare (EW) is deployed to do selective violence to the electromagnetic spectrum such that your capabilities are available and your enemies' are not. EW systems vary in size and form, from pocket-sized devices to truck-mounted radar arrays and transceivers, and include devices for countering and suppressing the enemy's communications, radars, guided missiles and drones, protecting your own personnel, military facilities, and equipment from the influence of enemy EW, and for detecting coordinates and information about the location and actions of the enemy (6). 

Russia has dominated this area in the past, however inroads are being made and despite the profusion of counter-drone jammers now being fielded, a combination of hardware, tactics and operator skill mean that a higher proportion of Ukrainian drones are getting through than ever. As I've described, if drones can become autonomous it will be a huge development that will change the tactical and strategic landscape, by completely avoiding the pitfalls that come with operating on the EMS. Another development is the use of terrain recognition systems, which can self-locate and navigate independently of any need for communication. As competition continues to evolve the landscape the need to harden your own assets against EW will become more decisive, and autonomy will continue to be valued higher.

# Quantity
If drones are becoming qualitatively better, it is also the case that they are becoming more numerous. Quantity has a quality all of its own. As I stated at the beginning of this essay, in the first two months of 2024, the Ukrainian defense industry produced about 200 thousand FPV drones, on the road to a goal of 2 million this year. If we assume this production trend to match the more prolific use of drones, we can estimate that Ukraine will be going from ~10 thousand drones expended per month in May 2023, to up to 100 thousand per month without decreasing their stockpile. A battlefield with hundreds of thousands of UAVs in action every month is a radical change that could affect the war in any number of ways that are hard to predict. Already Ukrainian defenses have become a maw for untrained, unaware Russian soldiers who are sent in by callous commanders to completely exposed positions. A recent article "Battling Under a Canopy of Drones'' from the New Yorker describes the situation. 

> a steady stream of small groups of Russian infantrymen—between two and six soldiers each—walked to Tabaivka from the east. Few made it across the three-hundred-yard gap. The snow had relented, and Boyko easily stalked the groups with the surveillance drone. Perun bounded between the panel and the radio, shouting himself hoarse, calculating azimuths, and correcting the aim of his stormers, snipers, and machine gunners. It was madness: Russians kept marching down the same paths, to the same spots where their comrades had just died. One 1st Battalion machine gunner later told me he had fired his weapon so much that it had kept him warm in his frigid dugout. He couldn't see the men he was killing. But since they kept reappearing in certain places, he memorised different branches below which he could point his barrel to hit specific coordinates up to a mile away… When a 1st Battalion sniper shot and wounded a Russian near the entrance, Litsey—whom Perun had left in charge of the operations center while he rested—ordered the sniper not to finish him. He wanted the Russians in the cellar to hear the soldier dying slowly and pleading for help. During a siege, Litsey told me, "it's important to lower their morale." (7)

This quote captures the harsh reality of conscripted Russian soldiers, forced by their government to advance and overwhelm sophisticated Ukrainian defenses with sheer numbers. The question remains whether mass is as relevant a factor as it was on the Eastern Front in WW2, or if technology has evolved to make the balance between attacker and defender more asymmetric towards the defender. It is probable that in 2024 it will be possible to saturate the battlespace with human-controlled drone hunter-killers, and further possible that this will inflict so much damage on Russia's conventional offensive as to create a frozen front with the modern equivalent of trench warfare. Unfortunately this doesn't mean Russia will be unable to accomplish its' war aims, which at this point seem to simply be destroying Ukraine even if they cannot take it. Ex-US military strategic thinker John Robb makes grim prophecy of these developments:

> "For the people fighting this war, burrowed in the earth and constantly fearful whenever exposed, it will be a horror, one that builds on and exceeds the WW1-style trench warfare that set the previous standard."

This assertion is reflected by Ukrainian soldiers in reality already today, as in the New Yorker article: 

> "Dig as much as you can and cover yourselves with ponchos or branches, so that you won't be seen by thermal," he (Ukrainian commander) radioed Sever. "Dig like a mole if you don't want to die." (7)

While the front is slow moving, fixed-wing drones will fly hundreds of kilometres to disrupt operational and strategic targets. This has already been seen with Ukrainian forces hitting Russian oil refineries up to 900 km away from the front, with 9 of these attacks this year (8). 

# Implications
Where this conflict goes is uncertain, but what is certain is that men will continue to die in huge numbers, both armies will continue to use drones in higher numbers and with higher efficiency, and developments will be made in this war that will make UAVs a constant asset in future conflicts. The advancements in drone capabilities and autonomy, and the production lines building millions of UAVs per year will not disappear even if the war ends this year. The lessons learned in Ukraine will be picked up by every military in the world, and not just by large organisations, but also by smaller groups who wish to accomplish their aims with violence - guerillas.  

Let's look to the future as it slowly materialises in front of us. Drones at any level of autonomy, make it possible for pariah states and non-state actors to wage war in new ways, in which the balance may not favour the defender. In many cases the dynamic is not well described by attacker vs defender, but more by static vs moving. An example of this we already see with Houthi forces causing billions of dollars of damage by denying sea lane access to Western ships with cheap drones. Near peer state actors could do much worse, and with cold wars with Russia, China and Iran looming, it is possible that the global commercial environment could be completely disrupted by blockades of air, land and sea. A second development that is made possible by increasing drone autonomy is the weakening of correlation between military manpower and capability. As autonomous weapons make it possible to substitute hardware for men over a range of military tasks, it becomes possible for wealthy nations (or even individuals) to field military or police force with few human participants. Thus the goals of a group or despot will not even need to be palatable to the forces they use to achieve them. 

A final implication and one that I think is understudied is the proliferation of imagery from warzones, distributed in a social media environment, and weaponised to win a moral cause or international support. Today, you can go on Telegram and access any number of chats that report on warzones in Ukraine or Palestine, from both sides of the conflict. Any evidence for any moral case you want to make is accessible 24/7. Does this level of transparency improve the level of understanding and empathy in a civilian populace? Does it lead to bloodthirstiness - as with people celebrating the deaths of masses of Russian soldiers by Ukrainian FPV drones - or does it lead to war weariness and less propensity to conflict in democracies? Does bringing the war home to Western populations constrain their governments in providing support to strategically important allies - as with Ukraine - or does it constrain the worst impulses of a deeply corrupt Western order - as some would say with Israel? Many questions abound in the evolving space of information war.

None of this is a very clear prediction of the future, however two things can be seen to be true. Firstly, that drone technology will continue to improve, and it will change the way war is fought between nation states and also open capabilities to other groups who would use them for harm. Secondly, the information environment will be saturated with imagery from all over the globe, and will be harnessed to drum up support, moral indignation, and adjust the political realities for warfighting groups. Much more has to be done in differential technology and strategic development to face these realities, and ensure that a democratic, liberal order is maintained into the future and not relegated to the dustbin of history. Some of the most powerful words that underlie the attitudes of Ukrainians in this war were uttered by FPV ace "Darwin": *"It is not the strongest that survive, but the most adaptable."* These words are ones we should live by.
