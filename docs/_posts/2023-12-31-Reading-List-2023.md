*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* - *Philip K Dick*
Brilliant. Truly weird and powerful, love it so much. The ending is as fantastic as every other Philip K Dick book. Watch Blade Runner again. 

*On The Move: A Life* - *Oliver Sacks*
What a strange and interesting person. I'm particularly inspired by his swimming and weightlifting, lifelong writing practice and his holidays. He was a writer, doctor, lover of people, insular and so many things in his life, it makes me want to do more. 

*Stories of Your Life and Others* - *Ted Chiang*
Story of Your Life, and Division by Zero.
To read Exhalation, What's Expected of Us, and The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate.

*The Epiphany of Gliese 581* - *Fernando Boretti*
Really interesting ideas, love the idea of the jackal as God, so many references that i need to track down. Message him on twitter in appreciation. 

*The Name of the Wind* - *Patrick Rothfuss*
Awesome as ever, so much about story and music and how that relates to myth and what is real. So well done. I realised how on the nose about Kvothe's talents it is, but even if a little embarrassing I still love this book and want to listen to the next one. 

*The Three-Body Problem* - *Cuixin Liu*
I was a little confused for a lot of the book, something about the style and translation was new. This was reflected by the translators note at the end, that Chinese and western lit culture is diferent. I like the book but not as much as I thought I would, but by the end I definitely loved the descriptions of Trisolaran technology, the unfolding of protons into other dimensions and inscribing a supercomputer into them. Awesome stuff, need to read the rest of the series. 

*Children of Time* - *Adrian Tchaikovsky*
Really great and thoughtful science-fiction. Loved the evolutionary biology plot points, and was so impressed by how my reaction changed from complete horror at the spiders to awe and almost tears at some points. Really liked it but don't know if I'll read the rest of the series at the moment. 

*Roadside Picnic* - *Strugatsky Brothers*
Strange and evocative, good original ideas that have percolated to me through other stuff so not entirely novel. I didn't really understand the end, it was a little unsatisfying. Ah okay; Redrick is disillusioned and doesn't know what to wish for from the golden sphere, he incidentally wishes for something good to be left inside him, and is ironically brought to a similar obsession as the boy when he says: "HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY, FREE, AND MAY NO ONE BE LEFT BEHIND!".

*When We Cease To Understand The World* - *Benjamin Labutat*
Brilliant second reading. The first chapter about Prussian blue, Fritz Haber, chemical warfare, his wife shooting herself in the chest, himself saving a billion people from starvation and killing millions in death camps; brilliant. Grothendieck's heart of the heart of mathematics as well intrigues me to no end. I should recommend this to people, but who? 

*Giovanni's Room* - *James Baldwin*
Brilliantly sensitive and well written, almost painful to read at times and loaded with so much emotional energy as to be unbearable. I loved it. 

*The Beginning of Infinity* - *David Deutsch*
Probably the best book I've read in my life. Completely deconstructs so many arguments against human flourishing and progress. Improved my understanding of knowledge and epistemology immeasurably since I had never really thought about these topics before. His conception of the scientific method as driven by explanations and not induction from experiment sorted out an underlying conflict in my making sense of the world that I can't believe isn't more understood by everyone in the world and taught in every school. This book also taught me quantum physics and opened my mind to so many ideas in physics that I realise now I had never truly taken seriously. I need to read this again, follow all these ideas further, and write about and take notes from each chapter because this book is so full of good ideas, well explained. 

*The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* - *Roger Williams*
Interesting, certainly follows a lot of ideas I've had before - the loss of meaning due to abundance, which we already have a shadow of today. Some uncomfortable scenes that made me realise I'm maybe less bloodthirsty than when I was a kid. It makes a lot of sense to me that if death has no meaning, and you know that pain will not continue, you would seek out obscene levels of pain just to make life a little interesting. I think that if I live essentially forever I would try basically everything possible just for some novelty - getting dropped in the ocean and slowly drowning, climbing mountains with no gear, getting stuck in a sunken submarine etc.

*A Casino Odyssey in Cyberspace* - *Roger Williams*
A short story set in the universe of the above. The only thing you can't get in a universe where every human is protected from harm is the misery of another human i.e. this is the final currency in the casino. 

*Death in Spring* - *Merce Rodoreda*
Very good, and disturbing. Ripped off faces and bones and children stuck in cupboards. I feel some kind of allegory to repression on creativity, traditions that are harmful, superstition as a force of evil. 

*Accelerando* - *Charles Stross*
Really fun and entertaining, he loves throwing in all kinds of ideas that can be thought provoking. Lots of interesting stuff about virtual realities, copies of people and downloaded minds, new economic structures, and the reason why civilisations might stay closer to home - the bandwidth gap. Any distance you are from the computing centre of the universe you are condemning yourself to a slow existence. 

*The Sirens of Titan* - *Kurt Vonnegut*
Very funny, lots of words I didn't know, and very well crafted and self contained story. All about finding meaning in a universe that uses you for its own ends, and how good it is to be used. The part about an alien race Transmogorians (or something) replaced by their machines definitely has relevance in the culture today and it's funny to think these ideas haven't really developed that much since he wrote it.  

*Tokyo Redux* - *David Pearce*
Great and eerie crime / historical fiction. Such interesting scenery of postwar Japan. I'm sure the others are just as good read them. 

*The Algebraist* - *Iain Banks*
Pretty standard fare for Iain Banks, hope this preceded the Culture series cause if not it's a tired retreading. Virtually no surprises, hidden AI's meant to be the big one but falls flat. Can't believe I managed to finish it to be honest, I may have given Banks to much slack and expected a great ending. 

*Elon Musk* - *Walter Isaacson*
Didn't like it at all, shit pulpy newspaper writing. Boring and not a lot of novel ideas about Elon that I couldn't have already imagined. Somewhat interesting to see how Elon researches and reads all about a certain subject, pushes urgency with "surges", and clearly has a strong drive to see humans reach mars. Maybe to do anything big like this you need that huge desire and the urgency it creates to see a world where your vision has been made manifest. What is my vision? 

*The Tall Man* - *Chloe Hooper*
A very balanced, well written book that is super enthralling and distressing. The police union speeches, marches and quotes made me sick. At the same time we've (Australian government) condemned Aboriginal people to a strange wasteland with no private property or agency, and no opportunity. What do we think would happen? Is the another way? Is it purposefully like this? Or just incidental because no one wants to think about it? Is the voice just another step in reconciliation that actually does nothing, and is just words that lead to no change, forever. 

*The Maniac* - *Benjamin Labutat*
I love this guys writing, but this book was less interesting and terrifying than his first. I see he wants to build on this idea of technological progress and intelligence as a force that is leading us somewhere or lying in wait but he doesn't convince me so much here. The most interesting part is about von Neumann looking to create artificial life, through evolution on one of the first computers. The final bit about go was not that great. 

*Minor Detail* - *Adania Shibli*
Short, well written second half. Brutal first half that I sped through. Very interesting about checkpoints, borders, bombings in Gaza. 

*The Book of Sand* - *Borges*
Beguiling stories with interesting metaphor, skilfully wrought and will reward rereading. 

*Kaputt* - *Curzio Malaparte*
Brilliantly depicts the baseness and frivolity of europes descent into hell in WW2, chronicling both victim and victimiser at once and displaying the war from the fascist side. Still preserves the humaneness. I really loved this. So many descriptions of northern nights and war fronts, animal metaphors. Horses drowned and frozen in a lake, eyeballs in a box, a flood of cripples into caves to escape from bomb√≠ng. Stumbles at points with confusing court scenes but when it produces it is incredible. 

*Train Dreams* - *Denis Johnson*
I love Denis Johnson read everything he's got.
