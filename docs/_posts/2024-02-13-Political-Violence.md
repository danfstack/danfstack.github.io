# Lessons from Say Nothing and a Savage War of Peace
![Grande hazaña! Con muertos!, Francisco Goya](/assets/images/goya.jpeg)

My father used to talk about boys from his village in the calm south of Ireland, missing a game of Gaelic to head north for the weekend, and coming back the next weekend with stories hidden behind closed mouths and grim eyes. Everything is left unsaid in these parts of the world, but the assumption was they had gone to do missions for the Irish Republican Army. I was always interested in and implicitly supported the actions of groups like the IRA, fighting for a noble cause with less noble means. However, recently the use of violence by insurgents against an occupying force have been more harshly illuminated by the October 7 massacre by Hamas in Israel. This event, and reading books like *Say Nothing* by Patrick Radden O'Keefe, and *A Savage War of Peace* by Alistair Horne - on a similiar insurgency in Algeria against the French - beg questions about the fascinating and dark reality of guerilla warfare. How do rebel groups like the IRA and the National Liberation Front (FLN) in Algeria envision the use of violence in pursuing their goals? How does conflict begin and escalate? And how does such internecine violence ever reach a conclusion? This essay seeks to develop some answers to these questions.

The story begins in Ireland as well as Algeria where there is latent political consciousness due to a history of mistreatment by a great power. This is catalysed by a show of resistance, brought about in the Irish case by ~1200 in rebel forces at the Easter Rising in 1916, and the Algerian a similar magnitude of civilian protesters in the V.E. day protests in Setif in 1945, who are put down brutally and clumsily by the state and in the Algerian case pied noir settler vigilantes as well. The frenzied reaction of the state, followed by a long period of intensified occupation, is its own demise. Insurgency breeds escalatory dynamics and eventually an environment of anarchy - as Yeats had it *"... days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare / rides upon sleep"* [*Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen*, W.B. Yeats]. Finally, compromise on the part of the state seems the only way to end agony, and a peace process is long and complex while casualties rise on both sides. I will go over each of these stages in further detail and try to answer the question of why events have a shade of inevitability to them without strong and progressive policy at the outset.

# Ignition

The Easter Rising was launched by Irish republicans against British rule in Ireland during Easter Week in 1916, with the aim of establishing an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was fighting the First World War. Irish leaders had been demanding home rule for a long time; indeed, such a bill was languishing in the Statute Book in London, deferred until the end of the war. The Rising in hindsight should have been punished with prison time for the ringleaders, however instead fifteen were court-martialed and shot in the first two weeks of May, effectively martyring them in the eyes of the public. J.C. Beckett in his "The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923" identified that now "Ireland was quickly passing under the most dangerous of all tyrannies - the tyranny of the dead". By killing the ringleaders, the British government had choked the legitimate Irish republican party out of existence, enraged the public, and cleared the way for the more radical Sinn Fein. We can see a similar dynamic in the beginning of Algerian nationalism after the Setif revolt and the extremely violent reaction from France and its pied noir settlers.

On the morning of 8 May 1945, the inhabitants of the largely Muslim town of Setif were preparing for a mass march. It was V.E. Day; for Europe, the first day of peace following the Nazi capitulation the previous night. France had thrown off the yoke of its occupier and now Algeria desired the same. Once underway the protest was ignited by unknown interlocutors - whether a French policeman or armed demonstrators in the crowd fired the first shot is unclear - and began widespread slaughter of Europeans, in the end leaving 103 dead. After five days the army was called in to put down the revolt, and 'pacification' by French forces, and the European settlers themselves began. In the end they would kill thousands (the number is unclear, French historians believe 6,000, Algerian nationalists 45,000) in *ratissages* ("raking-over", involving widespread bombings, executions) and vigilante killings. The reaction hardened moderate Algerians' attitudes towards France, and many of the later leaders of the FLN would trace to this point their belief that armed uprising would soon become necessary. Kateb Yacine, the Algerian novelist, identifies this:

> my sense of humanity was affronted for the first time by the most atrocious sights. I was sixteen years old. The shock which I felt at the pitiless butchery that caused the deaths of thousands of Muslims, I have never forgotten. From that moment my nationalism took definite form.

Although war wouldn't begin for another nine years, this event and the French state's reaction to it laid the seeds for revolution, and began the process by which hundreds of thousands would die or be expelled from their homes, and the Fourth French Republic would fall.

# Immoderation

These events not only harshly brought to light the savagery with which an occupying nation would put down rebel groups, but also removed the more moderate and compromising force that a state could have dealt with in the future. In both cases resistance is driven underground, to groups that would see violence as their only resort by which to bring about the change they desired. In Ireland's case, later riots against conscription in WW1 lead to the arrest in 1918 of more moderate leaders De Valera and Griffith and handed the future of the movement to the more radical Michael Collins. In Algeria, the French policy of breaking up the great traditional families in times of relative peace would lead to later, much more difficult times in which they found they had no acceptable representatives to deal with. Instead;

> in suppressing the forces of resistance in this fashion, we were also suppressing our means of action. The result is that we are today confronted by a sort of human dust on which we have no influence and in which movements take place which are to us unknown. [*A Savage War of Peace*, Alistair Horne]

This is a key factor in the difficulty of the state in political dealings and negotiation when violence escalated.

# Proliferation

Events lead to an increase in the intensity and magnitude of occupying forces in an attempt to quell further rebellion. It is a predictable outcome, one that occurred previously with the British in Palestine and Cyprus, the Portuguese in Mozambique, and the French in Indo-China. It is the playbook of a nation caught unawares by rebel action:

> First comes the mass indiscriminate round-up of suspects, most of them innocent but converted into ardent militants by the fact of their imprisonment; then the setting of faces against liberal reforms designed to tackle the root of the trouble; followed, finally, when too late, by a new, progressive policy of liberalisation. [*A Savage War of Peace*, Alistair Horne]

For rebel groups this dynamic is one that must be understood and taken advantage of. The Irish may have been the first in a long line of groups who developed the tactic for revolution - in provoking an occupying force - that is later succinctly described by the Brazilian guerilla leader Carlos Marighella in his *Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla*:

> It is necessary to turn political crisis into armed conflict by performing violent actions that will force those in power to transform the political situation of the country into a military situation. That will alienate the masses, who, from then on, will revolt against the army and the police and blame them for this state of things.

The basic strategy wouldn't fully succeed in either Brazil, Ireland or Algeria, but was certainly the main idea behind the militant forces there, and would devolve into blind terrorism from all quarters and conclude with a war-weary population stuck in a torpor of horror.

# The Paradox of Terror

How did the home front feel about the growing intensity of conflict in their colonial possessions? It is best characterised by the concept of the paradox of terror; during the Troubles, English opinion was variously unconcerned by what was happening *"over there"* or appalled by use of terrorist tactics by the IRA in its bombing campaign. The paradox lies in the violent actions of heavily armed British soldiers on Irish land during the occupation, and heavily armored Land Rovers patrolling the streets, and is conveniently ignored by English public opinion. In only identifying the reaction against these forces as terrorism, they miss the fundamental reason that Irish republicanism would continue to thrive. For the Catholic public it was an easy answer to the question of who had brought terror to this particular environment - the British. Violence was first brought to Belfast by Protestants, in particular the Ulster Volunteer Force who disrupted Catholic marches, and then reinforced by British troops brought in to quell the disturbance. As a former IRA member Albert Price said:

> We beat them with stones at first, and they had guns. Our people had to go and get guns. Wouldn't they have been right stupid people to stand there? Our people got shotguns at first and then got better weapons. And then the British, who were supposed to protect us, came in and raided our homes. What way could you fight? So you went down and you blew them up. That was the only thing left. If they hadn't interfered with us, there probably would be no Provo army today. [*Say Nothing*, Patrick Radden O'Keefe]

This dynamic has been occurring since the time of the Romans, who's legionnaires were a terrifying force sent from afar to control Celtiberian slaves working New Carthage silver mines.

> Occasionally these slaves rose to attack the Romans, who, seeing a sentry assassinated or a detachment ambushed and annihilated, no doubt spoke feelingly about the use of terrorist tactics. What options did the natives hold either to rid themselves of the Roman presence or to convert it to a more salutary form? Only one: force. What kind of force? That which was limited to what their minds could evoke. Lacking arms, training, and organization, they had to rely on wits, on surprise raids, ambushes, massacres. Was this terror or was it counterterror? [*War in the Shadows: The Guerilla in History*, Robert Asprey]

# Escalation

No matter the feelings of the home front in these conflicts, beginning to fight an insurgency creates its own escalatory dynamics. At the beginning of the 1970's in Belfast there may have begun a policy of deescalation and attrition but it fell victim to overwhelming circumstances. British army tactics, higher command intransigence, RUC and "B" Special operations, and right-wing guerrilla terrorist acts already had turned a majority of Catholics against the government and its security forces to make them either sympathisers with, supporters of, or participants in IRA operations. As matters stood, violence could only escalate.

> Police-state methods turned Ireland into a hostile land, with British forces occupying tiny enclaves and those not entirely secure. Neither the Auxiliaries nor the Black and Tans were trained in counterinsurgency warfare. From the beginning, they presented easy targets to Irish terrorists. In attempting to ferret out miscreants, their heavy hands often fell on innocent civilians, thus further alienating an already hostile population. Each repressive measure worsened matters. No one citizen trusted the other. The old man in the worn trenchcoat standing quietly in a crowd might whip out a pistol and shoot a policeman; the young blade with the pretty girl might throw a hand grenade at a military post. Then the Crossley tenders - awkward lorries holding eight to ten police - would race to the scene, the Black and Tans arresting without caution, interrogating without discretion, on occasion employing torture. [*Say Nothing*, Patrick Radden O'Keefe]

The way in which civilians and soldiers participated in atrocities throughout both conflicts is hard to understand without seeing how vicious tit-for-tat can become. Excesses on one side produced excesses on the other side. The thin veneer of civilisation had been scratched off and underneath it was fear. This is best described in *A Savage War of Peace*. The quote concerns a detachment of French troops who were pinned down overnight by a rebel band.

> …two hundred yards in front of them lay two wounded paras. Three men had gone out at intervals in an effort to reach them, but after each had been wounded the captain forbade any further attempts. One of them, V., returned to consciousness in the cold night air, and called ceaselessly to his comrades for succour:
> 
> My poor friend V. lay howling on his bed of stones till morning. He suffered unimaginably, both physically and mentally, a prey to mortal terror. He only really stopped at dawn, when we could perhaps have saved him. For several hours a rebel had been slithering towards him. He could have seen him all that while. There he was. The rebel touched his body. He took away his weapons. Then he gouged out his eyes. Then he slashed his Achilles' tendons, afraid, perhaps, that he might still come back and die with us. But he didn't finish him off, merely wanting him to have to lie still and suffer. His friend T., the sergent-chef, also died shortly afterwards, a hundred yards away, his eyes gouged and tendons slashed; a slow death, while we were waiting for the dawn…

Soldiers in Algeria accustomed themselves never to say *"'Watch out, you're going to get yourself killed,' but one repeats several times a day, 'Make a mistake, and you have your balls cut off."'* It was what the French soldier expected, and he reacted accordingly. In an article entitled "Stretching a Soldier's Patience", *The Times* of 7 June 1973 described how Belfasters cheered when four British soldiers were blown up and horribly mutilated by a mine, and how other British soldiers witnessing the episode *"were shocked and embittered by what they thought was a callous disregard for life"*. Multiply this several hundred times for the additional horrors of the fighting in Algeria, for the far greater numbers involved, and for the altogether less phlegmatic character of the French soldier, and the occasional angry backlash or infraction of discipline becomes inevitable.

This derangement extended to the attitudes of children in the conflict as well. Frantz Fanon tells grim anecdotes about Algerian teenagers; in one, a thirteen- and a fourteen-year-old Muslim, who had murdered a thirteen-year-old European school friend, explained:

> "We weren't a bit cross with him. Every Thursday we used to go and play with catapults together, on the hill above the village. He was a good friend of ours…."
> 
> "But why did you pick on him?"
> 
> "Because he used to play with us. Another boy wouldn't have gone up the hill with us."

In another:

> "What would you do if you were invisible?" — a topic brightly suggested to the 22-year-old French teacher on a recent "psychological education course". Composed (with illustrations) spontaneously in the classroom, and not as homework under parental influence, the pupils wrote:
> 
> "I'd rob a French bank…."
> 
> "I'd kill French soldiers; even the Zouaves…."
> 
> "I'd steal my mother's sugar to make a bomb…."

# Deescalation

How do you repair a society which has devolved to such violent attitudes? It is, perhaps obviously, very difficult. The difficulty is increased by the political intransigence of your enemy, who can resolve to wait out the conflict without any compromise on their initial goals. This is in stark contrast to a democratic nation, whose leaders necessarily change, and whose populace rarely have the will to continue fighting a horrific war in which violence has reached such levels.

In 1959, de Gaulle grandly offered the Algerians a *paix des braves*. The principle was: first stop fighting, lay down your arms, then we will come up with a political settlement. But the FLN emphatically slammed the door in de Gaulle's face, declaring: no, settlement first, then we surrender our arms. It was a blueprint followed later - with success - by the IRA. As for Algeria, in 1962 de Gaulle was forced to accept the FLN's terms under the worst possible circumstances, abandoning every single one of France's negotiating points - and one million French citizens.

In Ireland, the road to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement (which brought a fragile peace), was arduous and involved numerous peace talks and negotiation throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s. Both the negotiations in Algeria and Ireland illustrate the failure of moderates to prevail against the extremist minority on either side. Every time political settlement was sought, the same problem arose. No sooner had a peaceful-sounding overture been made than pressure from the protagonists of "no compromise" would force the leader who made them to renege with harsh and intransigent noises towards the other side, which in turn would engender more reservations. This acts in combination with the continual breaking of ceasefires by the most militant groups on the rebel side, who seek to drag parties away from the negotiating table so that their aim of absolutely no compromise can be met. In the case of the state, they cannot be seen by their citizens to be dealing with a violent and terroristic counterparty, and are under huge pressure to break negotiations themselves and impose more force. Eventually settlement is reached, but this is after long negotiation where casualties in the conflict continue to mount, civilian populations become increasingly weary of violence, and great compromises are made on the part of the state. 

# Lessons Not Learned

The political difficulty goes along with the tactical difficulty of fighting an insurgency where you necessarily cannot be everywhere at once and your troops become easy targets. The terrorist has the strategic asymmetry eloquently named by the IRA after they tried to kill Thatcher in the Brighton bombing (well covered in Rory Carroll’s book Killing Thatcher) *“Today we were unlucky, but remember, we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always”*. In the long run you lose the moral battle as well as the tactical battle, as if the occupation continues long enough, your own troops will be implicated in the escalating violence, and resort to the same methods used by the terrorist: indiscriminate bombing and murder, imprisonment, and seeking information through torture. 

Democracies cannot occupy because of the political and strategic difficulty of fighting an insurgency. In parts of the world where occupation still occurs there will necessarily be escalatory dynamics, and the gradual radicalisation of moderates as conflict continues. In both the Troubles and the French-Algerian war a plague, a la Camus, *“had swallowed up everything and everyone. No longer were there individual destinies; only a collective destiny, made of plague and the emotions shared by all.”* Today conflicts like these continue, in Algeria and North Africa itself, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Israel - Palestine. The lessons of the Troubles and the Algerian War are that: insurgency can form quickly when great force is used to suppress dissent; there are escalatory dynamics in counterinsurgency, which can lead to democratic nations resorting to the methods of the adversary such as indiscriminate killing and the use of torture; and negotiating an end to these conflicts is very difficult, not least because of the radicalisation of moderates on both sides. In particular and enduring importance for civilians in Western democracies, who today have as much access the realities of war as ever before, and may see torture or internment as necessary in conducting it, *"If really we are capable of a moral reflex which our adversary has not, this is the best justification for our cause, and even for our victory [Pierre-Henri Simon].”*
